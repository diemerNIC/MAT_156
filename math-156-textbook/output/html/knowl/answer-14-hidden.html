<body class="ignore-math"><div class="answer solution-like">"Jason does his marking or goes to a movie but not both" is true provided exactly one of the two conditions is true.  If he does his marking, then he cannot also go to a movie or else the exclusive disjunction is false.  If he goes to a movie, then he cannot also do his marking or the statement is false.  Truth of the statement means he doesn’t do both, and he doesn’t do neither.</div></body>
