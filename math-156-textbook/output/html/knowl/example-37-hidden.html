<p>Answer: "Jason does his marking and goes to a movie" is true provided that Jason does his marking and also goes to a movie. If he does one or the other <em class="emphasis">but not both</em>, then the statement "Jason does his marking and goes to a movie" is false.  It is also false if Jason does neither action.</p></article></body>
