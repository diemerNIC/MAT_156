<div class="para">Under what conditions is the statement “Jason does his marking or goes to a movie” true?</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Answer: “Jason does his marking or goes to a movie” is true provided at least one of the statements “Jason does his marking” or “Jason goes to a movie” is true.  If Jason does his marking, then the compound sentence is true regardless of whether Jason goes to a movie or not.  Similarly, if Jason goes to a movie, then the compound sentence is true whether Jason does his marking or not.  In complete detail, the inclusive disjunction is true if <em class="emphasis">any</em> of the following are true:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Jason does his marking and also goes to a movie.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Jason does his marking but does not go to a movie.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Jason goes to a movie but does not do his marking.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">The only case in which "Jason does his marking or goes to a movie" is false is if Jason neither goes to a movie nor does his marking.</div>
