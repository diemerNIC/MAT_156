<div class="para">One way to represent the action of a gate is by using a truth table.  As is usual in a truth table, all possible combinations of the input voltages are given, as well as the output of the gate for each set of inputs.  Each input voltage is given a symbol, such as <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  When the input signal is off, the value of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is given as 0, and when it is on, the value of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is 1.  The associated truth table then looks exactly like those we studied with logical propositions.</div>
