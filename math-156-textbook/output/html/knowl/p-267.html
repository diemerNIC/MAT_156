<p>Let's look at another example.  Suppose that the following conditional is true: “If Barney is a dog, then Barney has four legs.”  This means that if the first proposition, “Barney is a dog,” is true, then only one conclusion may be reached, that the second is true and Barney has four legs.  However, if <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is false (that is, Barney is not a dog), then our conditional <em class="emphasis">doesn't have anything to say</em> about the number of legs Barney may have.  If Barney is a snake, octopus, bug, person, or pond, then Barney may not have four legs.  If Barney is cat, giraffe, wooly mammoth, or a table, then Barney may have four legs.  Our coditional does not deal with what you may conclude when <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is false (that is, when Barney is not a dog). <article class="example example-like"><a href="" class="example-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/exmpl-cond1-hidden.html" title="Example 2.7.1"><h4 class="heading">
