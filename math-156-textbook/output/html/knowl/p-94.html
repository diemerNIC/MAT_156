<p>Examples of statements that are <em class="emphasis">not</em> propositions:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Will you do your homework tonight?</p></li>
<li><p>Please pass the butter.</p></li>
<li><p>She was late for class this morning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">The first is not a  proposition because questions cannot be propositions. (The <em class="emphasis">answer</em> to the question very well may be a proposition.)  The second one is a command and cannot be said to be either true or false.  The third of these examples is not a proposition because, taking the statement on its own, the truth value depends on who <em class="emphasis">she</em> is.  If, however, that statement were expanded to become, "My roommate's name is Laura and she was late for class this morning," then <em class="emphasis">she</em> is clearly defined to be Laura and the whole sentence is a proposition.</p>
