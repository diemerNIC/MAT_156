<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">The paper is initially 0.097 mm thick with no folds.  After one fold, the thickness will be <span class="process-math">\(0.097\times2\text{,}\)</span> after two folds <span class="process-math">\(0.097\times2\times2\text{,}\)</span> etc.  So our starting term (zero folds) will be <span class="process-math">\(a_0=0.097\)</span> and then will double with r = 2 thereafter, where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is not only the index but also the number of folds made. So <span class="process-math">\({a_n} = 0.097{\left( 2 \right)^n}\text{,}\)</span> and the term with seven folds will be <span class="process-math">\({a_7} = 0.097{\left( 2 \right)^7} = 12.416\text{,}\)</span> so we can conclude that the paper thickness will be 12.4 mm, or just over 1 cm thick. (The Mythbusters realized that the problems with paperfolding lie with the fold itself, and making the fold lie as flat as possible.  If I remember correctly, they resorted to C-clamps and hitting the fold with a hammer to flatten it.)</div></body>
